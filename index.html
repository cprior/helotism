                    <p>Where is the good old "under construction" gif when you need it? ;) This webpage is slowly filled with the lessons learned during the setup of my personal cluster. The RSS feed informs about new content. If there is any wrong information: That qualifies as an issue on GitHub.</p>

                        <h1>Keeping up with the Devops</h1>
                        <p>This cluster is meant as a personal learning experience to keep up with the development in IT when it comes to horizontal scaling and distributed data flows.</p>

<p>This video shows the *complicated* version that already exists. This webpage will document the journey towards a slightly less complicated variant. But this is no vapourware! ;)</p>

<h2>The goals</h2>

<p>As other people have already figured out, the small development boards are perfectly suited to experiment with clustered hard- and software. The tagline "Yet another&hellip;" is a nod towards their inspiration.</p>

<p>This project does hardly cover new ground. Nevertheless in a methodological way answers to inevitable questions are given.</p>

                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>Although introduced to early computers as a learning method in primary school I was never involved with them when growing up. Only after school I got interested in "how does spiegel.de function"? This led to exhaustive knowledge in the creation of dynamic webpages. The Helotism project is also helping me to catch up with what has changed since about 2010.</p>

<p>As a business guy I see so much potential in analysing data not just to generate data-about-data, but also to improve real physical products.</p>
